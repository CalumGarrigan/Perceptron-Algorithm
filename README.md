# Perceptron-Algorithm
In this assignment, the focus was on understanding and implementing the Perceptron algorithm, a foundational concept in machine learning primarily used for binary classification tasks. The Perceptron algorithm works by iteratively updating weights to learn a linear decision boundary that separates two classes in a dataset. Employing basic data science techniques, such as supervised learning and classification, to implement the algorithm in Python.

Following the provided pseudo code, Perceptron algorithm was developed, ensuring that the implementation closely followed the fundamental principles discussed in lectures. This involved initializing weights, training the model on a given dataset to discern between different classes, and subsequently evaluating its performance on separate test data. Through this process, we gained practical experience in training and testing machine learning models.

Expanding beyond binary classification, we extended the Perceptron algorithm to handle multi-class classification using the 1-vs-rest approach. This approach involves training multiple binary classifiers, each focused on distinguishing one class from the rest, and combining their outputs to make predictions across multiple classes. By adapting the Perceptron algorithm for more complex classification tasks, I gained insights into algorithmic design and problem-solving in machine learning.

Additionally, I introduced regularization to the multi-class classifier to prevent overfitting, a common issue in machine learning models. Regularization helps improve the model's generalization performance by penalizing large weights. By varying the regularization coefficient, I explored its impact on classification accuracies, demonstrating the importance of model optimization techniques in improving performance.

Overall, this assignment provided valuable hands-on experience with fundamental data science techniques, including supervised learning, binary and multi-class classification, and model optimization. Through the implementation and analysis of the Perceptron algorithm, I deepened my understanding of its underlying principles and practical considerations in real-world applications.
